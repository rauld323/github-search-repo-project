# github-search-repo-project

## About

Hello thereðŸ‘‹ ! I recently completed a project focused on developing a search tool utilizing `React` and `React-Query`, specifically targeting GitHub usernames to display corresponding repositories. The key areas of emphasis in this project were responsiveness and efficient state management.
To achieve responsiveness, I leveraged `Tailwind`, utilizing its tools to maintain consistent and uniform elements throughout the application. This ensured a smooth and adaptable user interface across various devices and screen sizes.

For state management, I opted for `React-Query`. This decision enabled me to effectively handle different states such as loading and error, enhancing the overall user experience by providing clear feedback on ongoing processes. Moreover, beyond managing states, `React-Query`'s caching capability significantly improved the project's performance. Users can observe this enhancement when searching for different users, then returning to a previously searched username without the need to re-submit, as the data remains cached.

Additionally, apart from these primary focuses, I developed a comprehensive `Storybook` for the project's components, facilitating better understanding and testing of these elements. Furthermore, the project has been successfully deployed.

## How to run:

To run the project, type `npm run dev`

To run storybook, type `npm run storybook`

## Future Improvements:

There's ample room for enhancing the shareable components within the project. Presently, these components were tailored specifically to meet the requirements of this particular project. However, there's a great opportunity to make them more versatile and dynamic. The aim would be to create components adaptable to various contexts, ensuring scalability and flexibility. This approach would streamline development efforts, avoiding the need to create different iterations of similar elements and instead offering adaptable components suitable for diverse scenarios.

Regarding the DataFrame component, while it maintains responsiveness, I recognize its simplicity may not fully meet the desired standards. Unfortunately, due to time constraints, I wasn't able to dedicate efforts toward refining the description section. Given more time, I would aim to enrich its features and presentation, ensuring a more comprehensive and detailed output for users.

Refactor, refactor, refactorâ€¦.
